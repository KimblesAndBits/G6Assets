## Concept

Corporations of all shapes and sizes have issues properly managing their IT assets.  This leads to poor budgeting, loss of financials, poor ROI, high TCO (total cost of ownership), and frustrated employees languishing on old, out-dated hardware.

G6 Software aims to make it quick and easy for admins to manage their complete inventory of assets and report on those assets.  Employee users will also be able to get a view into all assets assigned to them and when they are due for refresh on key components.

Role based permissions will route users to admin or employee experiences.  Assets will be stored in a robust relational database.  Potential automation via QR codes will be explored.

## Audience

IT Service Management professionals at any company of any size or discipline.  Anyone who owns IT assets will benefit from this software.
